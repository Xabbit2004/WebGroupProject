This is a library management website, that connects to a MySQL database using a PHP framework.

In it you can register as a User or an Admin, which will decide which version of the website you will see, admin for admin, and user for user.
After this you will login under that account and be taken to your respective homepage.

For the admins, you can now add, delete, or edit the availability of books in the database.

For the users, you can now search for books in the database, and check them out. To do so the user needs to search the full title of the books and 
then select the check out button next to the search. The users can also access their dashboard with the My Dashboard button. This page will tell them
what books they have checked out, as well as when those books will need to be returned by to avoid any late fees.

At any point in either admin or user, you can select the logout button to logout of the website, doing this will reirect you to the login page.
