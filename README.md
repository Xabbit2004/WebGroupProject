# WebGroupProject

This is a Library Management Website system. The main site is connected to a database of books which can be checked out, or placed on hold.

First you launch the website which will take you to the homework page.

From there you will login to gain access to the books you've checked out or placed on hold.

After that you can search for a book, or get recommendations based off of a genre.
